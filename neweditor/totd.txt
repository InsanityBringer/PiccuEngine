You can change display settings for the panes of a room frame individually or all at once. To change the settings on an individual pane, right-click in the pane and choose a setting from the drop-down menu. To change the settings of all panes in the active room frame, choose a setting from the View menu instead.
&&
You can open up to 50 ORFs (room files) at a time, and each will open in its own window, but you may only open up one level (D3L) at a time. (Note: If you must open multiple levels, you can run more than one instance of the editor. However, copy/paste functions will not work across editor instances.)
&&
The current grid setting for an orthographic (2D) room pane determines the distance that marked vertices (or the camera) move with each keypress. Change the setting by right-clicking on the pane and choosing "Adjust grid size" from the drop-down menu.
&&
To display textures and room geometry more accurately in the textured views, make sure the z buffer is in use. Click the "Z Buffer" button in the toolbar to activate the z buffer.
